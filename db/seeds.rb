# movie = Movie.create(title: "Jerry Maguire", year:1996, plot:"One of Cameron Crowe’s best films became something of a punchline with its heavily quoted lines (“Show me the money,” “You had me at hello,” everything that cute kid says), but it’s actually a wonderful romantic comedy that has held up incredibly well in the quarter-century since its release.

It’s sweet, smart, and funny.")
